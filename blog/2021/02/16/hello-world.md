I finally pulled the trigger and made this blog my live website. I decided to go forward with the learning in public/blogging project about a week ago but I was still working on putting the website together. At this point, there clearly isn't much to the site itself. It's bootstrapped with [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) and I've made a couple of minor tweaks. I'm still learning the static site generator game and figuring out how this site will take shape.

I am hosting this for free with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Deploying the site was extremely easy. It took about 5 minutes.

1. Sign up for a free Netlify account.
2. Push the website to a GitHub repository.
3. Connect Netlify to the GitHub repository.
4. Repoint the name servers for my domain with my existing host to Netlify's DNS servers.

I'm also pretty excited about the new deployment workflow to push updates to the production site.

1. Push updates to my GitHub repo.

That's it. There's only one step. Netlify automatically builds and deploys the site to their [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) any time I push changes to my master branch. Very cool!

I am feeling a bit distracted from my regularly scheduled programming (pun intended). I don't have much free time these days so I like to spend as much of it as possible writing code and working on React apps. I'm still working on website stuff so at least I'm in the right ballpark. That being said, it might take a while for this website to take shape while I try to balance all of my projects.
